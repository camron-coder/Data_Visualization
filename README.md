# Data_Visualization

For a data visualization project I using the charts.js code to help put the data in a bar chart and chatgpt to not only help with gathering the data but also writing most of the code so that I could iterate through it faster. This project was a lot of fun because through the use of A.I. I got to take a basic idea I had and expand it beyond what I though I could do with it.
